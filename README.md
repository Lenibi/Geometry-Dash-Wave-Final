## Description

A simple clone of the wave gamemode from Geometry Dash. Quickly made this for fun in a couple hours.
The trail effect was challenging. It is made by instantiating a rhombus (or square rotated 45 degrees) at the player position over and over.
Death particle effect, spinning saws, music, replay. 

## How to play
